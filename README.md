## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
To create a web platform that connects users with nearby e-waste collection facilities and educates them about the importance of proper e-waste disposal. It gamifies the process by rewarding users with points based on the estimated precious metals recovered from their devices.

The webpage can be used to report sightings of harmfull waste lying in public, when users report these sightings, and when such waste gets cleared up Both the reporter and the cleaner gets a small sum of points, which can be redeemed for useful rewards in the webpage. The webpage features a Local map, which will display the density and the amount of waste in a given area using the intensity of colours, It also allows Cleaner groups to form groups within them and work as a team, This colabrative work gains more points to Each of the cleaner.
